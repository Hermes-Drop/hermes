# handle arduino code here (assuming python)
# make them functions that are callable
#
# 1) convert x,y direction to degrees
#       degrees is then used to tell arduino to make servos rotate X degrees
#       assume that any instructions you get will purely be translational not rotational
#
# 2) actually sending the degrees into the arduino
